      "description": "The Megaminx, previously called as Hungarian Supernova was patented by Uwe Mèffert. It is a dodecahedron-shaped face-turning twisty puzzle which is very similar to the classic Rubik’s Cube. The solution is almost the same, just a few new algorithms come in when you reach the last layer, so if you’re familiar with the classic 3x3x3 Cube then you won't have problems solving the Megaminx either.",
